To register it just add the following code when you are building your service provider
```
services.AddSingleton<ITelemetryInitializer>(new ServiceNameInitializer(<RoleName>));
```

## AvoidSamplingTelemetryInitializer
Prevents metrics, which match the specified condition, to be sample on the client-side
To register it just add the following code when you are building your service provider
```
services.AddSingleton<ITelemetryInitializer>(
    new AvoidSamplingTelemetryInitializer(
        t => t is RequestTelemetry telemetry && telemetry.Name == operationName))
```

## AvoidRequestSamplingTelemetryInitializer
Just a small convenient wrapper around `AvoidSamplingTelemetryInitializer`

```
services.AddSingleton<ITelemetryInitializer>(
    new AvoidRequestSamplingTelemetryInitializer(operationName))
```

## TelemetryClientExtensions.ExecuteAsRequest/TelemetryClientExtensions.ExecuteAsRequestAsync
Executes operations as `RequestTelemetry`
Usage
```
await telemetryClient.ExecuteAsRequestAsync(new ExecuteAsRequestAsyncOptions(operationName, func));
```
### Optional fields
* `Action<IOperationHolder<RequestTelemetry>>? Configure` - if more telemetry details need to be added. Is called right before operations itself
* `int? FlushWait` - time for telemetry to be pushed. Usefull for console apps. In secondss - default 15
* `Action? PostExecute` - is called after an operation just before operation.Dispose(). That means logs will still be attached to the RequestTelemetry and method execution time will be included
